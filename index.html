    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p class="info">I am an aspiring programmer that loves a good challenge. I enjoy back-end programming the most but I do enjoy a little front-end design.</p>

    <p class="info">I love to learn new things and have always been up for a good mental challenge. I believe critical thinking is important not only in programming and developing but life in general.</p>

    <p class="info">I have a beautiful family and we are striving to make each day a little better than the last. We love playing outside. Whether its fishing, camping, or just a Sunday drive, the mountain fresh air brings happiness to the soul.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

    <p>I am from beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalispell,_Montana">Kalispell, MT.</a> It's a small town with tons of outdoor activities. Good fishing, good snow, and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm">Glacier Park</a> is what this place is all about.</p>

    <p>I have lived here pretty much my whole life except for a quick adventure to San Jose, CA. Once you have lived in a place like this it hard to find a reason to leave and I probably never will find that reason.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>

    <P>I have been in housing construction most of my working career and love building things. Programming gives me the opportunity to still build things with my hands but in a different challenging way.</p>

    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>

    <p>I love fishing. Especially bass and fly fishing. I also love to do anything outdoors. Camping, hiking, dirt biking, snowmobiling, and snowboarding are all my favorites.</p>

    <h2>Whats your dream job?</h2>

    <p>My dream job is not a job at all. I want a career that brings enjoyment everytime I step into my "office". I ultimately want to create products that make a difference in peoples lives.</p>

    <h2>What's important to me?</h2>

    <p>I hold God, my family, my country, and fun at the top of my list. I believe in more of us putting aside differences and treating each other how we would like to be treated. We all want the same thing at the core, so let's make it happen.</p>
